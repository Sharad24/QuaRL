# Quantized Reinforcement Learning (QuaRL)
Code for QuaRL, a framework for evaluating the effects of quantization on reinforcement learning policies across different environments, training algorithms and quantization methods. 

Supported Environments:
* Atari (Pong, Breakout, BeamRider, ...)
* OpenAI Gym (Walker2D, HalfCheetah, BipedalWalker, MountainCarContinuous, ...)
* 

Supported Reinforcement Learning Algorithms:
* Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
* Actor Critic (A2C)
* Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG)
* DQN (Deep Q Networks)

Supported quantization methods
* Post-training Quantization
* Quantization Aware Training
